<h3>Therapy and Vision Centre</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<b>It is people who count, not the disability!</b>
<br><br>
This was our first attempt at addressing the needs of children with multiple disabilities and vision impairment. The centre was opened in 2007 after we retrained ourselves in handling visual impairment. The work at the centre involves assessment, holistic intervention, regular follow up, parental guidance and counselling. While working with the children, the special educators also train parents.
</p><p>
A comprehensive programme of all-round development including orientation and mobility, communication, peer interaction, play and pre-Brailles skills, are planned. Children with low vision are trained to use their vision effectively. Communication aids, writing aids and other learning materials are modified to suit the needs of children with multiple disabilities and vision impairment.
</p><p>
Mrs Natarajan who had equipped herself with training in special education started the services with three students and three staff members. The parent training programme under Home Management, was our first project in 1985. Its objectives are to work on strategies that will empower parents of children with neurological impairments to include their children within their homes and support their inclusion in the community.

<p>
Vidya Sagar today runs several programmes reaching out to over 3800 individuals with disabilities. This has been possible by setting up high quality delivery of services, focusing on early intervention, special education, physiotherapy, speech and communication therapy, vision training, occupational therapy, co-curricular activities, counselling, vocational training, exploring and creating employment opportunities and training of resource persons to work in the field of disability.
</p><p>
The vision centre is open twice a week in the evening to enable children attending regular schools to access its services. We cater to over 400 students in any given year.
